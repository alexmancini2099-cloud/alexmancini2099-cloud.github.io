    This project was the result of a school assignment where our team was tasked with writing a script, and then adapting it to a visual medium. We chose to make a visual novel game. The time frame for this project was 4 months.â€‹</p>
   
    
   <p> Our team was comprised of four members. I helped write the original script, and was the main artist, asset creator, and character designer. Liam was the other writer of the script, and helped with the programming, 3D modelling and music. Anthony helped with the backgrounds and other graphic elements. Timothy adapted the script and programmed our game's battle system.</p>
   
   
   <p>The main objective of this project was to successfully adapt a script to another medium. Our script followed a disgruntled janitor battling through a haunted office building with other employees. We decided to do a visual novel. This seemed like the best option based on our skill sets, as well as the content of the story.</p>
    
   <p>The greatest challenge of this project was preparing the visual assets. Drawing backgrounds *and* characters can be very time consuming, so I thought of a more efficient method. This method was to use mostly photographs as the game's backgrounds. Since we had access to an office building via my dad, that part wasn't a problem. However, we were still missing some locations, such as the prison, the main character's apartment, the Elevator and the final boss's room. We ended up using drawings and 3D modelling to fill in the blanks.</p>
    
    <p>Another hurdle was the character designs. We originally planned to use stock images for the haunted office supplies as a joke/time-saving measure. However, our professor recommended that we create our own character sprites for them. I ended up designing most of the monsters, with another teammate contributing one design. This ended up benefitting our game in the long run, as our custom designs were more expressive than the lifeless stock images we were planning to use.</p>
 
   <p>At the end of the day, this game was really fun to work on. I enjoyed getting to express myself through story and art. We learned how it's more fun to create your own assets rather than borrowing them (when possible of course). I would love to work on this type of game again.</p>
    

    <h3>Video Editing for Short Film Interview</h3>

    <p>This was a school project where the task was to create an interview or documentary that related to the theme of "rain" in Vancouver. Our time frame was about 3 months.</p>

    <p>Our team was comprised of four members. I worked on the lighting, video editing, and visual effects. Jon was the main sound editor, and also contributed to the visual effects. Sanya was the director and camera person, and Muskan was the main cinematographer. This page shows the progression of our title screen from the raw footage to a fully edited intro.</p>

    <p>The main objective of this project was to use documentary or interview filmmaking to represent how rain is significant to Vancouver's culture. Our class was working in collaboration with the Museum of Vancouver, with the chance of some of our films being featured in their "rain" exhibition.</p>

    <p>Our group looked into local authors who wrote about rain, and came across Carellin Brooks, who wrote a book titled "One Hundred Days of Rain". The book follows a woman who copes with divorce and parenting struggles while reflecting on Vancouver's rainy climate. After contacting her, we were able to get an interview.</p>

    <p>Before filming the interview, we needed to shoot some B-Roll that fit the theme of our film. However, we had a problem. On the day we were all able to shoot, it did not rain at all. Therefore, we had to get creative. As the visual effects editor, I needed to add rain in digitally. While we did end up getting some rainy B-Roll another day, the title screen still uses the edited sky with fake rain and a fake cloudy sky. This page will showcase the process from raw footage to the final version of the intro.</p>

    <p>We ended up learning a lot as a team. We had to adapt to fit the limitations of whether, with both digital editing and rigorous scheduling to make sure we had people getting footage we needed. Personally, I learned a lot of hard skills with After Effects. I had a better understanding of masking and overlays with my quest to fake precipitation. In the future, we'll make sure to pay more attention to the weather reports so our filming conditions are perfect.</p>
